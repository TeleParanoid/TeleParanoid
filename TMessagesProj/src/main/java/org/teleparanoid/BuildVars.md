You should crate your own `BuildVars.java`
[**Obtain your own api_id**](https://core.telegram.org/api/obtaining_api_id) for your application.

```java
package org.teleparanoid;

public class BuildVars {
    public static int APP_ID = 4; // you should change to your APP_ID
    public static String APP_HASH = "014b35b6184100b085b0d0572f9b5103"; // you should change to your APP_HASH
```
